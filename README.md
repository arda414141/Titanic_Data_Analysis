# Titanic Data Analysis

This project performs a basic analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Objectives
- Explore and clean the dataset.
- Handle missing data effectively.
- Analyze survival rates based on gender and class.
- Visualize the results.

## Results
1. **Survival Rate by Gender**:
   - Females had a significantly higher survival rate (~74%) compared to males (~19%).

2. **Survival Rate by Class**:
   - First-class passengers had the highest survival rate (~62%).
   - Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rate (~24%).

## Visualizations
The notebook includes the following visualizations:
- Bar charts showing survival rates by gender and class.
- Missing data visualization before and after cleaning.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
2. Open the `titanic_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Files in This Repository
- **titanic_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file containing the full analysis.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
